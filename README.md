# Conservation Dynamic Madagascar

## Overview
This repository documents the transparent methodology used to produce a dynamic dataset detailing the historical evolution of protected areas in Madagascar (2000-2024). The dataset itself is not hosted here but can be reproduced following the procedures outlined in this repository.

## Objectives
- Provide a reproducible and transparent workflow for generating a dynamic dataset of protected areas in Madagascar.
- Address the limitations of static datasets by preserving information on past configurations of protected areas.
- Promote open science and encourage collaboration in conservation research.

## Key Features
- **Reproducible Workflow**: Step-by-step instructions and scripts for compiling, cleaning, and structuring the data.
- **Documentation**: Detailed descriptions of methods, sources, and assumptions.
- **Open Collaboration**: Tools and guidelines to engage with the conservation and research communities.

## Structure
The repository contains:
1. **Scripts**: R code for processing and structuring geospatial and tabular data.
2. **Documentation**: Explanations of the methodology, including data sources, validation steps, and assumptions.
3. **Examples**: Sample outputs to illustrate the expected results.

## Usage
This repository is intended for:
- Researchers and practitioners in conservation seeking to reproduce or adapt the methodology.
- Analysts aiming to explore the temporal dynamics of protected areas.
- Educators and students studying conservation data management.
