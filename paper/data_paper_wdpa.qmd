**Reconstructing Protected Area Histories: A 15-Year Consolidated WDPA
Dataset (2010-2024)**

**Florent Bédécarrats**

**Summary**

Protected areas spatial data, which includes their location and
characteristics, is an essential source for conservation studies.
National and international databases that provide this information
typically include the current boundaries of protected areas, as well as
their attributes such as creation date, status, and manager. However,
this data structure results in a significant loss of information
regarding past states of protected areas when their boundaries or
characteristics have changed over time. This practice leads to erroneous
results when using the data to analyze the evolution of protected areas
or evaluate their impact on the environment and living conditions. It
also omits phenomena like degazetting, leading to previously existing
protected areas being treated as if they never existed.

To address this problem, we developed a spatiotemporal dataset
consolidating data published by the World Database on Protected Areas
(WDPA) since 2010. We compiled an annual dataset, referencing the month
of October or the closest available month when October data was not
available.

The data for 2010-2024 was obtained through extensive archival research
to retrieve historical records published by WDPA, as only the latest
public datasets are available on protectedplanet.net. Google Earth
Engine archives data from as far back as 2017, and we found data for the
years 2010 to 2016 in UNEP-WCMC\'s AWS public repository.

Data schemas have evolved over time, and we undertook harmonization
efforts to align attributes across different versions of the dataset.

All processing was carried out on the SSP Cloud platform, provided by
INSEE for data scientists working with the French public
administrations. This platform consists of a Kubernetes cluster with a
simplified interface for configuring, launching, and managing pods,
along with a data lake for large-scale and efficient storage using S3.

The result is a dataset comprising 2,721,134 protected area-year
records, producing a 22.3GB parquet file. The geometries of protected
areas are complex and account for over 95% of the data volume.
De-duplicating this number of observations is computationally intensive.
We use the Blake3 algorithm, a deterministic cryptographic hash function
that consistently produces the same hash value for identical input data,
making it highly effective for data de-duplication. It is among the most
efficient available, implemented in C within our code. The hashes
produced by Blake3 serve as keys to separate attribute data from spatial
data.

As a result, we obtained two parquet files that contain all the WDPA
data for the past 15 years for 365,592 PAs: one containing 2,721,134 PA
annual attributes (190MB) and another containing 1,425,023 unique
spatial geometries (13.9GB).

Using Parquet format provides advantages for handling large datasets,
including efficient reading and writing speed, compression, selective
column access, and partitioning, allowing users to filter and load only
portions of the data into memory. Parquet\'s compatibility with various
data processing tools also facilitates integration into different
research workflows.

The WDPA dataset used in this study is subject to specific licensing
conditions provided by UNEP-WCMC. The data is available for
non-commercial use only, and any derivative work may not be used for
commercial purposes without prior written permission. Redistribution or
sub-licensing of the data is also prohibited. Proper attribution is
required for any use or publication involving the dataset, and users
must ensure that the latest version of the data is being used.
